# To Do

## Unity

 - Day / night cycle
    - Make dusk / dawn one hour long?
    - Should "night" be true during dusk and dawn?
    - Moon looks like a sun
 - Create a "Startup" scene containing just the core GameObjects / scripts
    - This should then load the scene containing the actual location
 - Weather
 - Press escape to quit
 - Fine-tune physics
    - Jump feels a little unsatisfying
 - Hide mouse
 - Crosshair
 - Store tile types on the Terrain object
    - We should be able to get the tile type at some co-ordinates
 - Terrain elevation
 - Footstep sounds
 - Changing scenes (doors)
    - DayNightCycle should deactivate when entering interiors
 - Loading adjacent chunks
 - Minimap
 - Inventory
 - Combat
