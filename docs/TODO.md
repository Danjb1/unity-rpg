# To Do

## Unity

### Sky

 - Move clouds onto a separate sky "layer"?
 - Improve cloud texture
 - Slowly rotate cloud layer horizontally to give the effect of movement
 - Write a custom skybox shader to render a gradient background
 - Change gradient colours over time
 - Add sun / moon objects that slowly orbit the camera
 - Weather

### Gameplay

 - Create a "Startup" scene containing just the core GameObjects / scripts
    - This should then load the scene containing the actual location
 - Fine-tune physics
    - Jump feels a little unsatisfying
 - Changing scenes (doors)
    - DayNightCycle should deactivate when entering interiors
 - Loading adjacent chunks
 - Combat
    - Melee
    - Ranged

### Terrain

 - Store tile types on the Terrain object
    - We should be able to get the tile type at some co-ordinates
 - Terrain elevation
